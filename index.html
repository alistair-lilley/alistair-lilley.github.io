        <h1>Welcome to the Wonderful Worlds<br>of Rhys Raleigh Robbins</h1>

        <p id="homeintro">Hello to all you far travelers who have happened upon this page!<br><br> My name is Rhys Raleigh Robbins.<br><br> I am a hobbyist writer, but most of my writings take the shape of Dungeons & Dragons homebrew content. I like to write adventures and magic items, but I do also dabble in writing non-D&D works, including prose and poetry.<br><br> I engaged in collaborative projects with the amazing Twitch streamer <a href=https://www.twitch.tv/gamingwithevery1>GamingWithEvery1</a>, a fellow D&D player and a great friend of mine. Go check out his content as well!<br><br> This website is currently under construction, so not much will be found here yet.<br><br> Regardless, enjoy your stay!</p>
